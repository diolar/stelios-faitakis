Being invited by the curator Katerina Gregou to participate in the first Riga Biennial, RIBOCA 1, entitled “Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More”, has been a great honor. Among 104 artists from all over the world, I present the work "New Religion". The artwork explores the concept of time, and change caused by science as the new religion that prevails from the beginning of the Enlightenment and dominates extensively in the Western world. RIBOCA 1 highlights the relationship of locality and universality, bringing to the fore key socio-political issues commenting on the pace and the quality of modern life. "New Religion" is in line with the content of the exhibition, as it depicts science, its basic principles and the people who practice it, reflecting the impact they have on the human condition.
