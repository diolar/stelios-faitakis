“Mandalas” are a new series of artworks that originate from the art of various cultures that interest me, mainly Tibetan and Japanese. Within my work, these cultural influences are formalistically and conceptually transformed into a modern visual language. The compositions remain circular, thus emphasizing the element of unity and wholeness, combining geometric abstraction with representation and incorporating elements that are characteristic of my work, such as irony and black humor. Mandalas show constructions, buildings, pills, molecular structures, rockets and other images that constitute an industrialized world that hovers between progress and self-destruction.
