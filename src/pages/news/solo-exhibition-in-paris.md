It is with great pleasure that I present my first solo exhibition in Paris, entitled "Scientific Dogma" at the Rabouan Moussion Gallery. A large-scale artwork from the exhibition was presented at the Riga Biennial, RIBOCA 1, in Latvia, where I also commented on the strong scientific dogmatism that prevails in advanced Western societies. I find the attachment on scientific knowledge intriguing, considering its current character, because we believe that it is the only source of "truth" that we can identify with and understand our nature. The exhibition "Scientific Dogma" includes, in addition to the large piece mentioned above, a series of works of various sizes, mainly made of wood (with the exception of a large work that is painted on canvas). There is another large artwork that does not hang on the wall, but is made of a wooden structure that stands on the ground.
